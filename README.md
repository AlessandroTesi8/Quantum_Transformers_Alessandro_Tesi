# Quantum_Transformers_Alessandro_Tesi

This project aims to implement the  Orthogonal patch wise neural network outlined in the paper [Quantum Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08167) by El Amine Cherrat, Iordanis Kerenidis, Natansh Mathur, Jonas Landman, Martin Strahm, Yun Yvonna Li, harnessing the power of quantum computing to enhance the capabilities of vision transformers. 

My work is primarily based on TensorFlow Quantum, a robust software framework that facilitates the construction, simulation, and training of quantum machine learning models. [TensorFlow Quantum: A Software Framework for Quantum Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02989) by Michael Broughton, Guillaume Verdon, Trevor McCourt, Antonio J. Martinez, Jae Hyeon Yoo, Sergei V. Isakov, Philip Massey, Ramin Halavati, Murphy Yuezhen Niu, Alexander Zlokapa, Evan Peters, Owen Lockwood, Andrea Skolik, Sofiene Jerbi, Vedran Dunjko, Martin Leib, Michael Streif, David Von Dollen, Hongxiang Chen, Shuxiang Cao, Roeland Wiersema, Hsin-Yuan Huang, Jarrod R. McClean, Ryan Babbush, Sergio Boixo, Dave Bacon, Alan K. Ho, Hartmut Neven, Masoud Mohseni.

Furthermore, I draw inspiration and insights from last year's Google Summer of Code (GSoC) projects focused on Quantum Vision Transformers. These projects, documented in detail on [Sal's GSoC blog](https://salcc.github.io/blog/gsoc23/) and [Eyüp B.
